##Amazon Lightsale WordPress website s3 hosted project



Deployed WordPress website running on an Amazon Lightsail instance to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket to store website images and attachments. 
I Configured a WordPress plugin with a set of Amazon Web Services (AWS) account credentials. 


The plugin then creates the Amazon S3 bucket and configures static website to use the buckets instead of the EC2 instanceâ€™s disk for website images and attachments.
Installed SSL/TLS certificates to domain
